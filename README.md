# Frontend Development:
1. Create a responsive webpage with the following features:
a. A fixed navbar that does not move when scrolling.
b. Below the navbar, create three sections: a left menu, a main content area,
and a right-side panel.
c. Include a footer at the bottom.
d. Make the left menu collapsible.
2. For the same webpage, write a JavaScript function that does the following:
a. If the screen width is between 992px and 1600px, shrink the page by 90%.
b. If the screen width is between 700px and 767px, shrink the page by 80%.
c. If the screen width is between 600px and 700px, shrink the width to 75%.
d. If the screen width is less than or equal to 600px, shrink the width to 50%

just clone this code and run in your environment- it's just a normal HTML code
